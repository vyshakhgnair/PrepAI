1,Given a Circle and Six Straight Lines. What is the maximum number of pieces that one can cut the circle using these six straight lines?,22,Just the value is enough !,"Using six lines, we can cut the circle into 22 pieces at maximum. Using one line, the circle can be divided into two parts. Two lines divide the circle into four parts. Three lines divide the circle into seven unequal parts. Four lines cut the circle into eleven parts. Using five lines, circle can be divided into sixteen parts. Finally, using six lines the maximum parts that can be formed are 22."
2,"A snail wishes to reach a water shore. To do this it must cross a wall which is 30 feet high. It has a time limit of 30 hours to reach atop the wall. The time starts as soon as it starts climbing the wall. However, he faces a problem while climbing. Every hour it climbs the wall 3 feet up, it slides down 2 feet. This occurs every hour. So how many hours will it take for the snail to reach atop the wall?",28,Just the value is enough !,"Every hour the snail climbs up 3 feet, it slides down 2 feet. So, the actual height it is climbing in 1 hour is 1 foot. Similarly, in 25 hours, the snail would have climbed 25 feet, in 26 hours it would have climbed 26 feet and in 27 hours it would have climbed 27 feet, but things change after 27 feet. As we know, the snail covers 3 feet up in 1 hour. So, in the 28th hour, the snail would have climbed 30 feet up the wall and would have reached atop the wall. Therefore the answer to this riddle is 28 hours."
3,You have a birthday cake and have to cut it into 8 equal pieces. What is the minumum number of cuts to achieve this?,3,Just the value is enough !,"Cut the cake into quarters (4 pieces) using 2 of the cuts – one horizontally down the centre of the cake and the other vertically down the centre of the cake. This will leave you with 4 pieces (or slices) of cake. Then take all 4 pieces and arrange them in a stack that is 4 pieces high. Finally, you can just cut that stack of 4 pieces in half – using your third and final cut – and then you will end up with 8 pieces of cake!"
4,"You have five pieces of chain, each consisting of three links. You want to make one long chain of these five pieces. Breaking open a link costs 1 Rs, and welding an open link costs 3 Rs. Is it possible to make one long chain of the five pieces, if you have just 15 Rs?",Yes,Yes/No,"Let us name the chains as  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each having three links. Take chain 1 and break open all three links: 1×3=3 Rs. Take one open link to connect chain 2 and 3:  3 Rs. Take another open link to connect chain 3 and 4:  3 Rs. Take third open link to connect chain 4 and 5:  3 Rs. Now you have one long chain ready in only 12 Rs "
5,You have 15 Rs with you. You go to a shop and shopkeeper tells you price as 1 Rs per chocolate. He also tells you that you can get a chocolate in return of 3 wrappers. How many maximum chocolates you can eat?,22,Just the value is enough !,"Buy and eat 15 chocolates. Return 15 wrappers and get 5 more chocolates. Return 3 wrappers, get 1 chocolate and eat it (keep 2 wrappers). Now we have 3 wrappers. Return 3 and get 1 more chocolate. So total chocolates = 15 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 22"
