Question_Number,Question,Answer
1,What are the various SDLC methodologies?,"There are 6 models: The waterfall model, V-shaped model, Iterative model, Spiral model, Big bang model, Agile model"
2,What is IPsec?,"IP Security (IPSec) is a group of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard protocols that provide data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication between two communication points over an IP network. Additionally, it describes the encryption, decryption, and authentication processes for packets. It outlines the protocols for secure key management and exchange."
3,What do you mean by the RSA algorithm?,"Data transfer security is provided by the RSA cryptography technique. This method encrypts data using a public key, while the decryption key is kept private or hidden. The encryption key, which is then made public along with an auxiliary value, is created using two enormous prime integers. Anyone can encrypt data using this public key, but only someone who is familiar with prime numbers may decrypt it. But because this method is thought to be sluggish, it is not generally employed to encrypt data."
4,What are the components of IPsec?,"Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): ESP offers all of the following services: data integrity, encryption, authentication, and anti-replay. Furthermore, payload authentication is supported.
Authentication Header(AH): This header does not provide encryption, but it does support data integrity, authentication, and anti-replay. Anti-replay security prevents unauthorized packet transmission. It does not guarantee data privacy.
IKE (Internet Key Exchange): It is a network security protocol that enables two devices to connect over a Security Association and exchange encryption keys on-the-fly (SA).  IKE (Internet Key Exchange) acts as an open framework for implementing widely used algorithms like SHA and MD5. It also protects the content of messages. "
5,What do you understand by piggybacking?,"Piggybacking typically has no harmful intent, just the desire to acquire free network access, but it can slow down data transfer for authorized users of the network."
6,Define NAT.,The term Network Address Translation is abbreviated as NAT (Network Address Translation). Rerouting traffic over a traffic routing device requires changing the IP headers of packets in order to remap one IP address space to another.
7,"What is Tensorflow, and What is it Used For? ",A software library called TensorFlow was created as an open-source resource for machine learning and neural network research by the Google Brain Team. Data-flow programming is done using it. Natural language processing and speech recognition are only two of the AI technologies that TensorFlow makes much simpler to incorporate into the software.
8,What do you mean by subnet mask?,A Subnet Mask is a number that indicates the range of IP addresses that can be utilized within a network. They are given subnets or subnetworks. These subnetworks are made up of LANs that are connected to the internet.
9,Define SLIP.,Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) is a TCP/IP-based fundamental protocol for communication through serial ports and routers. They enable previously configured computers for direct communication to communicate with one another.
10,What is a style sheet?,"It is a file that details how an HTML document or web page should be laid together. For instance, a stylesheet controls everything from fonts and sizes to margins and spacing for text. CSS is the most widely used format (Cascading style sheets)."
11,"What is machine learning, and how does it relate to AI?",Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. The concept is that machines will “learn” and improve at activities over time rather than requiring humans to constantly input settings. Machine learning is a practical application of artificial intelligence.
12,What is slice splicing in software testing? What are its two types?,"Slicing, also known as program slicing, is a software testing approach that uses a slice or a collection of program statements to test specific test cases or test conditions that may have an impact on a value at a specific point of interest.There are two forms of slicing: Static Slicing: All of the statements in a program’s static slice have the potential to alter a variable’s value at any time throughout any execution of the program. Static slices are typically larger. It takes into account every conceivable program execution.Dynamic slicing: A dynamic slice of a program consists of all the statements that truly affect a variable’s value at any given time for a particular program run. Dynamic slices are typically thinner. Only considers the execution of a specific program."
13,Explain memory leak in C++.,"Memory leakage occurs in C++ when programmers allocate memory dynamically using the new keyword or malloc()/calloc() and then fail to deallocate it using the delete() or delete[] operators or the free() function. One of the most common causes of memory leakage in C++ is the inappropriate usage of the delete operator. To free an array of data values, use the delete [] operator, but to remove a single allocated memory area, use the delete operator."
14,What do you understand by a command-line argument in C?,"C uses command-line arguments to retrieve parameters from the command prompt. In C, the main function accepts three arguments. They are as follows: Argument counter, Argument vector, Environment vector"
15,What is metadata? What is its purpose?,"Metadata is information about the data stored in an HTML document. This is accomplished by the use of thetag. Browsers, web services, and search engines can employ metadata to store information such as keywords, page descriptions, and the latest changed dates"
16, Define Java Development Kit (JDK).,JAVA Development Kit: JDK is short for Java Development Kit. It is a setting for the development of Java applications and applets. It actually exists. 
17, Define Java Runtime Environment (JRE).,JAVA Runtime Environment: The term Java Runtime Environment (JRE) refers to the Java Runtime Environment. It is the Java Virtual Machine implementation. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools used to develop Java applications.
18,Define Java Virtual Machine (JVM).,"JVM is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment for Java byte-code execution. It is a specification that describes the operation of the Java Virtual Machine. Oracle and other corporations have aided in its adoption. The program that implements it is known as JRE. JVMs are available for a wide range of hardware and software systems (so JVM is platform-dependent). When the Java class is executed, a runtime instance is produced. The JVM is split into three sections: Specification, Implementation, Instance."
19,What is Ethernet?,"Ethernet is a network technology that connects devices via cables for data transmission in Local Area Networks (LANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), and Wide Area Networks (WANs). It delivers services on the OSI Model's Physical and Data Link layers. The purpose of an Ethernet network is so computers and other devices can efficiently share files, information, and data. Ethernet was first introduced in 1980.

20,What do you mean by SQL Correlated Subqueries?,"A correlated sub-query is a sub-query that is dependent on another query. Sub-queries that are executed for each row of an outer query are referred to as correlated sub-queries. For each row in the outer query, each sub-query is executed once."
